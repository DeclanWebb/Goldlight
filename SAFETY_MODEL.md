# Goldlight Safety Model

Goldlight enforces strict boundaries:

- Not therapy
- Not medical advice
- Not crisis intervention

## Crisis Handling
- Keyword detection
- Immediate response
- External resources encouraged
- No continued conversation flow

## Dependency Prevention
- No exclusive language
- No emotional replacement framing

All safety logic lives in the backend.
